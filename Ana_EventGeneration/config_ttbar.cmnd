! ttbar production card

Main:numberOfEvents = 100

Beams:idA = 2212 ! first incoming beam is a 2212, i.e. a proton.
Beams:idB = 2212 ! second beam is also a proton.

Beams:eCM = 13000. ! the cm energy of collisions.

Top:gg2ttbar = on ! switch on the process g g -> t tbar.
Top:qqbar2ttbar = on ! switch on the process q qbar -> t tbar.
